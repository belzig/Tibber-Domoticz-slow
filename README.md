-------
Floppy999 archived the original repo. 
The original script unfortunately polls the Realtime Values every 10 sec, which leads to a DoS Attack of the Tibber server.

So this fork was necessary to fix the code in order to prevent the plugin from exessive polling, but its only a mitigation -
The complete Realtime Messurment Polling has to be redesigned.

Realtime Messurement is disabled by default.

If you want to enable it, you have to set. 
PUlse = 1 
in plugin.py

WARNING: Tibber probably will lock your API Key if you enable  RealtimeMessurement.
